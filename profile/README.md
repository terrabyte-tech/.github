Hello fellow techy, nerdy folks! We're Terrabyte, a green tech company focused on combining creativity and technology to provide solutions for the ongoing environmental crises. We're here to create a space for our coding projects, collaborate with each other, and to provide open-source solutions to some of our biggest headaches. We might be small, but as a team of passionate developers, designers, and activists &mdash; we are set on creating a difference.

Heard of [Pixel Planet Today](https://pixelplanettoday.com), a nature education project that pairs pixel art with facts about the planet? Or [Pinekeepers](https://pinekeepers.com), a game (when, once completed) will allow players to plant trees as they save them in-game? Those are us! We are excited to keep building these and other projects in the environmental tech space!
